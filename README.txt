Hi,

I have attempted this test. Here’s the individual project details:

Tasks. Api
	
	I have created API using FastEndPoint https://fast-endpoints.com/ which uses minimal api and CQRS and REPR pattern behind. I also used fluentvalidation which comes with FastEndPoints.

Tasks.App
	
	This is the web application using Blazor Server side. I'm also attaching final web application look.

Tasks.UnitTests

The api still needs unit tests also it was the requirement. I would like to finish the tests but I guess I had spent more time in the apis. 

If I would have more time I will fix these things:

Tests the api which includes all the services, repository and endpoints. 
Improve web application.
